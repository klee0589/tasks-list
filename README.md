# About the challenge 

Below, you'll find an exercise to represent the work you may encounter.  

> There is no single right answer — we've left it intentionally open-ended to understand how you think.


Our goals with this challenge are to: 

1. Learn as much as we can about how you work. 
2. Require as little of your time as possible, therefore it is capped at a maximum of 120 minutes. The core of the challenge should be solvable in less time than that. 
3. Introduce you to the types of challenges you might encounter in this role.

Please submit whatever you completed before the time limit. We will give feedback for every submission.   

# Getting started 

* Read through these instructions to make sure you understand what's expected. 
* Become familiar with the Task Manager. It is your central hub to interact with the code. With the Task Manager, you can run commands like `npm install` and `npm dev`. You will also use the Task Manager to submit your solution. Note: running a task can take a few seconds to complete. Only click on the run button once and allow the task to complete before running another task.

# Challenge: implement a context menu action 

You are given an example to-do app. Your task is to implement one of the actions in the context menu.

Your goals are to: 
* Pick one action: Copy, Favorite, Label change, Delete.
* Implement the action such that the UI is updated accordingly. 
* There is no requirement of updating the demo data on disk and keeping all changes in memory. Furthermore, you can hard-code values you would reasonably expect from an API. 

We do not recommend picking the Edit action as it can exceed the allotted time.  

Feel free to be creative — these are flexible guidelines and we're open to seeing any improvements you think are worth spending time on!  

# Submission instructions
